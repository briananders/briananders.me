Do you ever have that moment among friends when you say something that you think is 100% correct and one of your resourceful friends whips out their phone to fact check[READMORE]? Suddenly, you're filled with doubt. Or maybe you're confidently riding this plane down.

Said friend starts to read the wikipedia article about the subject in question, and he tells you that you were wrong. What do you do? Do you keep arguing? Do you become quiet and awkward from embarrassment?

Many people are too stubborn to accept being wrong. They are adamant that what they know, they know. But where does that get you. No one cares how loud your voice is, people are flawed, memories are flawed, and facts are facts. Being stubborn about it won't beat out facts. What should you do then?

I suggest you walk the high road and say "Oh, huh, I guess I was wrong. You learn something new every day."

Does that seem outrageous? Why are people afraid of admitting that they were wrong?

I posit that most people think that being wrong means that they failed. But are you a failure if you get something wrong? I think that's just something that school beats into us. In school, each wrong answer was a micro failure that added up to a bigger failure. I think lots of things are measured by our failures. We learn that it is wrong to fail and that when you're wrong you failed. It's very recursive.

What's wrong with failing? I think the failure is if you're unwilling to learn from your failures. It can be difficult to learn from failures, sure, but if you're too stubborn or ideological to change your perspective a little, then you're a sinking ship. I think you should live thinking that you're probably right, but could also be wrong about everything.

That sounds crazy, doesn't it. It may be. But a mentality like this will get you far. Confidence is good. Speak with confidence. But always defer to the facts. Being wrong doesn't mean you're weak. It doesn't mean you're a failure. It simply means that you thought you knew something that you didn't. Misinformation is out there everywhere. Right now you could start an email chain stating categorically that [sneezing leads to orgasms](http://www.snopes.com/science/stats/sneeze.asp). That chain email could circulated the world a few times and in some time be considered as fact. But, does that make it true? While it could very well be true, just because you said it, doesn't make it true.

Let's take a step back and cover what a fact is. Define Fact: a piece of information presented as having objective reality. Simply put: the truth.

With that in mind, let me throw a curveball at you.

What do we know about prehistory? History, we're pretty sure about. History literally means, the time of the past that humans have documented. That's why we call so much of the past "prehistoric"; it actually means, before documented history. So, our greatest historical scientists have said things about prehistoric man, or dinosaurs, or whatever. They're probably right. With all of the data that we have today, *this* is the logical solution. Clearly. But, given some more information, could these genius scientists be wrong? Probably.

WHOA! Hold the phone. Did I just say that these people are probably right and then turn around and say that they're probably wrong? WHAT? Madness. Or is it. Jumping back a couple of years, let's look at the view of space. The Earth was the center of the universe and everything revolved around it. Our greatest scientists and philosophers at the time swore up and down that everything we had supported this idea.

Then this dude, who had *more* data, said something like "The sun is actually the center, and we revolve around it." This was a huge revelation and naturally, with most people, change is bad. Galileo was the guy who suggested that bit of information and he got into a lot of trouble. But regardless of that, he proved to be right. Everyone before him was wrong. But everything pointed to one thing being the case while more data showed something else to be true. For a long time everyone thought they were right, when they were actually wrong. What a bunch of losers, right?

Do you know what the scientific method is? Essentially it's this: you get an idea, you test it, if it passes all of the tests, we call it a theory. Like, the [theory of gravity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation), or the [big bang theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang). Define theory: an idea that, when proven, we accept to be true and is used to build other information off of. I intentionally chose those two theories to reference because the general social acceptance is widely varying. Gravity: everyone agrees that gravity is a thing. The big bang: many people think that's how it worked, but many others think it's a crock. But the fact that they are both theories mean that they were both hypothesized, tested, and proven.

So, why are these theories given equal status? Because this is what a theory is: an idea that we're pretty sure is right, but could totally be wrong. Give more data, we could be way off. In the year 3014, they could be looking back and going, "What a bunch of nomads, thinking that it was 'gravity'. What a bunch of dummies."

That could be the case. But what's the harm? All of these ideas are stepping stones to real learning; to understanding everything. Why should you be afraid of being wrong when all that it means is that you can learn something?

My dad always told me "you can't go to bed unless you've learned something. If you didn't learn something, the day was a waste." And I think that's largely true. If we as individuals, or as a group, choose to stop learning and stop adapting, then we deserve to go extinct. Darwin taught me that.

So, don't be ashamed of being wrong, be invigorated by having learned something. Growth doesn't always have to be fun, but that doesn't mean that growth doesn't make you better.
