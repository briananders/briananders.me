We've all been in that situation where you have said something that you're dead certain about and it has just been revealed that you are wrong. You heart rate begins to quicken; sweat begins to form on your brow[READMORE]; fire and brimstone is raining from the sky-

Well, actually, it's not that bad, but I want to ask the question: who cares? Why is it that being wrong has such a deeply negative connotation? What's the big deal? I have some ideas.

### The Shame.

Naturally, there's that I-missed-a-step kind of shock when you something you thought to be true was disproven. As an extreme example, when Galileo said that we revolved around the Sun. Everyone else was like "Wha-?".

Depending on the circumstances the shame can very. There's the I just did a math problem wrong, whoops, that's kind of embarrassing. Or a little worse: I've been calling this co worker by the wrong name for 6 years. Kill me.

But still, why is that embarrassing?

### The Weakness.

Inherently, as a culture, we believe that knowledge is power. We hold up those with grand intellect far above those with incredible physical ability. You can probably name more famous scientists/mathematicians that died before your birth than you can great athletes or hard workers.

With this in mind, lacking knowledge, or appearing to lack knowledge can imply that you're not powerful; you're weak; you're poor. In an animal sense, nobody wants to be thought of as weak. Darwin had some choice words to say about the weak. But...

### Maybe It's All Attitude

Consider this: maybe no one else is embarrassed for you. Maybe no one else cares that you were wrong. Maybe you should just let it roll off of your back.

I once heard that "if you don't make a big deal out of it, it's not a big deal", and I have come to take that as somewhat of a motto.

I find that if you change your attitude to say, "I'm not ashamed of being wrong, I excited by a chance to learn", you will go a lot further in this world. What does getting upset do? Nothing. Being stubborn and insisting that you're right just makes you look even dumber. But turning it around and going "Wow, I did not know that! I'm glad to be set straight", will give the impression that you are very smart, you were just given bad data at some point. You'll also seem humble (a plus).

I ask you: what is there to lose? I posit that there's nothing to lose by being wrong and only things to gain.
